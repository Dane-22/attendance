# Settings — Help

## What this page does
- Lets you manage your account profile, password, and (for admins) system tools.

## How to use
1. Use the left-side tabs to switch between settings sections.
2. **Update Profile**: change name/email/profile image.
3. **Change Password**: enter current + new password and confirm.
4. **Admin/System Tools** (if visible): perform system-level actions like backups or diagnostics.

## Tips
- If you don’t see admin tools, your current role may not have access.
