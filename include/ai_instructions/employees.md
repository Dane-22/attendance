# Employees (Management) — Help

## What this page does
- Lets Admin/Super Admin manage employee records (view, search, add, edit).

## How to use
1. Use the **Search** box to find employees by name/ID.
2. Use pagination controls to navigate pages and change page size.
3. Use **Add Employee** to create a new worker record (if your role allows it).
4. Use **Edit** to update employee details (name, contact, status, position, etc.).

## Tips
- If edits are not saving or buttons are missing, confirm your role/permission.
